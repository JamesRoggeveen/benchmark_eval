    "input": "Consider a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a noninteracting band structure. The system can be described by the kinetic term of the following Hamiltonian:     $H_{\\text{Kinetic}} = \\sum_{s, k} E_s(k) c^\\dagger_s(k) c_s(k)$, where $E_s(k)=\\sum_{n} t_s(n) e^{-i k \\cdot n}$.     The hopping parameters are $t_1 = 6$ meV for nearest-neighbor hopping and $t_2 = 1$ meV for next-nearest-neighbor hopping, which correspond to $t_s(n)$ in the kinetic energy term. The spin index $s$ takes values in $\\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$.     What are the energies at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\Gamma$ point) for all bands in this system? Print your answer in the unit of meV, and separate all these energies with a comma, like {1, 2, 3, ...}.  Please render your answer in LaTeX format and place your final solution in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment. There should only be one $\\boxed{}$ environment.",
