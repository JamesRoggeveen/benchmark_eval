What are the coordinates of the Brillouin zone center ($\\Gamma$ point) for this lattice structure? Round your answers to 2 decimal places, and separate all these coordinates with a comma, like {(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...}.  Please render your answer in LaTeX format and place your final solution in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment. There should only be one $\\boxed{}$ environment.",
