    "input": "We are interested in solving the self-consistency equation for Hartree-Fock mean-field theory on a 2D triangular lattice associated with the following mean-field Hamiltonian $H = H_{\\text{Kinetic}} + H_{\\text{Hartree}} +H_{\\text{Fock}}$, with $H_{\\text{Kinetic}} = \\sum_{s, k} E_{s,k} c_{s,k}^\\dagger c_{s,k}$, where $E_{s,k}=\\sum_{n} t_{s,n} e^{-i k \\cdot n}$ at momentum $k$ with the spin index $s = 0,1$ for spin up and down. The mean-field terms are $H_{\\text{Hartree}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{s, t} \\sum_{k, p} U_0 \\langle c_{s,k}^\\dagger c_{s,k} \\rangle c_{t,p}^\\dagger c_{t,p}$, and $H_{\\text{Fock}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{s, t} \\sum_{k, p} U_{k - p} \\langle c_{s,k}^\\dagger c_{t,k} \\rangle c_{t,p}^\\dagger c_{s,p}$, where $U_k = \\sum_{n} U_n e^{-i k \\cdot n}$ is the repulsive interaction strength ($U_n>0$) in the momentum basis. What are the possible order parameters that preserve translational symmetry for a Hartree-Fock mean-field Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional triangular lattice? Print all possible order parameters (OP) separate by a semicolon enclosed by curvely bracket, e.g., {OP1;OP2;..},  In each order parameter, it should start with $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_k {{ANSWER}}$. You should only proivde the answer to replace {{ANSWER}} without repeating provided equations again (i.e., $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_k$). Express your answer in terms of $\\psi_k$ for the wavefunction at momentum $k$, $c_{0,k}$ and $c_{1,k}$, and their adjoint operators if necessary. Please render your answer in LaTeX format and place your final solution in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment. There should only be one $\\boxed{}$ environment.",
