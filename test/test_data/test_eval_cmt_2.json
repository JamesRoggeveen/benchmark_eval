    "input": "Consider a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a mean-field Hamiltonian described in momentum space. The Brillouin zone of this lattice forms a hexagon, where two corners are on the $k_y$ axis. What are the coordinates of the six Brillouin zone corners ($K$ and $K'$ points) for this lattice structure? Round your answers to 2 decimal places, and separate all these coordinates with a comma, like {(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...}.  Please render your answer in LaTeX format and place your final solution in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment. There should only be one $\\boxed{}$ environment.",
