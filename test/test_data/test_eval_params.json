    "input": "A doublet of strength $m$ is situated at the centre of a sphere of radius $a$. Find the radial $u$ and transversal $v$ velocities of the liquid in terms of $m$ and $a$ as a function of the spherical coordinates $r$, $\\theta$, and $\\psi$. Use only the variables and constants given in the problem; do not define additional constants. If necessary, numerical approximations are fine. Place your final solution in a $\\boxed{}$ LaTeX environment with all components of the solution separated by a semicolon ;.",
